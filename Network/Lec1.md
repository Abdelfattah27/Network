## definitions

1. **Computer networks** set of interconnected autonomous components
2. **Components**
   1. nodes/hosts : source/destination of data > laptops desktops
   2. intermediate / cooperating nodes : relaying on data among connected hosts > switch, hub ,router
   3. links : transmitting data between two adjacent nodes
3. **packet switched networks** : it implies the strategy of store and forward, **it's more efficient for computer network**
4. **circuit switched network** : first stablish a dedicated circuit across a sequence of links and thn allow the source node to send a stream of bits across this circuit to a destination
5. **addressing** : a mechanism of specifying and allocating a byte string that uniquely identifies a node or set of nodes
6. **ÙŒRouting** : process of determining systematically how to forward a packet towards a distinction based on it's address
7. **Router / Gateway** : a node specialized to connect two or more network
8. **Broad cast communication networks** : information transmitted by one node is received by other nodes in the network **_like_** Ethernet LAN
9. **Switched Communication network** : information transmitted to a set of designated nodes **_like_** WANs (Telephony Network, internet)
10. **Deterministic Multiplexing** : TDM/FDM the link is divided into slots (time or frequency ) and each node and send data in it's shred resource at any time but While a sender has no data to send, its share of resource (time slot,
    or frequency band) remains idle and idle resource cannot be used by other senders **_not suitable for computer communications_**
11. **Statistical Multiplexing** : Data is send on demand of each flow - flow can be packet or entire message - we can use **fifo** _First in first out_ or **Round-Robin** _each has round to send and if it hasn't data skipped_ and **Priority queue**
    - The source node may need to fragment the message into several packets, with the receiver reassembling the packets back - A switch becomes
    - Congested when it receives packets faster than the shared link can accommodate.
    - Appropriate to burst computer communications
    - Efficient network resource utilization
12. **Internet** : World wide publicly accessible network of interconnected computer network that transmit data using packet switched using internet protocol
13. **Modularization** : divide the whole system into a small and less complex blocks of different functionalities, these blocks are united with a well defined interface hid the complexity of block behind it
14. **Abstraction** : The act of hide implementation details behind a well defined interface, it's a fundamental tool used by system designers to manage complexity
15. **Layering** : Organize a network system into a succession of logically distinct entities, the service provided by one entity is solely based on the service provided by the lower level entity
    - _Modularity_ : easy to manage and maintain
    - _Reuse_ : upper layers can reuse the functionalities provide by th lower layer
    - _Abstract functionality_ : lower layer can changed without affecting the upper layer
16. **Entities** : Abstract object that mak up the layers of network system, provide communication services to upper layer entities by calling the communication services provided by the lower layer entities
17. **Protocol** : Specification of rules that are required for communication between two or more entities, protocols defines the interface between the layers in the same system and with the layers in the peer system
    - Each protocol object has two different interfaces
      - service interface
      - peer to peer interface
    - communication activities that governs b protocol
      - Format, order of messages sent and received among entities
      - Actions taken on messages
      - service interface to the upper layer
18. **Encapsulation** : by this approach protocol can carry control information to instruct its peer how to handle received data
19. **Header/trailer** : small data structure attached at the sender and detached at the receiver used among peer for communication with each other
20. **Network Architecture** : set of rules governing the form and content of an entity graph of network _like_ OSI model, network architecture, its a design a blueprint on how to organize the implementations of the computer network
21. **Bandwidth** the number of bits that can be transmitted over the network in a certain period of time
22. **Latency** : corresponding to how long a message takes to travel from one end to other
23. **RTT** corresponding to how long a message takes to travel from one end to other and back again
24. **Throughput** : the rate at which bits are transferred between sender and receiver
25. **Jitter** Variance in latency
26. **Delay \* BandWidthProduct** how many bits the sender can transmit before the first bit arrives at the receiver if the sender keeps the pipe full
27. **Network Adaptor** piece of hardware that connects a node to a link. it contains a signaling component that actually encodes bits into signals at the sending node and decodes signal into bits at the receiving node
28. **Baud rate** the rate at which the signal changes
29. **Byte oriented** View each frame as a collection of bytes rather than a collection of bits
30. **Bit Oriented** View the frame as a collection of bits rather than a collection of bytes
31. **Byte Stuffing** if any of sentinel characters appears in data we add _DLE_ parameter before it
32. **Bit stuffing** when transmitting five consecutive 1s insert 0 before transmitting the next bit
    - at receiver if received five consecutive 1s
      - next bi = 0 ? remove it
      - next bit is 1 ?
        - next bit is 0 ? the frame ends
        - next bit = 1 ? error
33. **Acknowledgment** a small control frame (header without data) that a protocol sends back to it's peer saying it has received an earlier frame
34. **Timeout** the action of waiting a reasonable amount of time
35. **Multiple access** a set of hosts can send and receive frames over a shared network, a frame sent by host is received by all other hosts but accepted by the intended host(s)
36. **MAC** distributed algorithm running on the nodes determine how thy can share the channel, when they can transmit frames
37. **Channel partitioning** divide the channel into small pieces (time slots, frequency, code) and allocate piece to node for exclusive use _like_ FDMA , TDMA
38. **Random access** Channel nor divided just allow collision and recover from collision _like_ ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CA, and CSMA/CD
39. **Take turns** nodes take turns to send, but nodes with more data can take longer turns _like_ bluetooth, token ring, FDDI
40. **CSMA/CD**
    1. **Carrier sense** means that the node can destingush between idle and busy link
    2. **multiple access** means that set of nodes can send and receive ove ra shared link
    3. **Collision detection** means that the node can listen while transmit so it can detect when the frame is collided with other frame
41. **Repeater** device used to forward digital signals much like amplifier in forwarding analog signals
42. **HUB** multiple variant repeater
43. **Transceiver** A small device attached to the tp of ethernet, detects if the line is idle and drive the outgoing signals and receive the incoming signals
44. **Terminator** attached to the end of each segment to absorb the signal and keep it from bouncing back
45.
